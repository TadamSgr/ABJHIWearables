# Application of wearable technology and Vivametrica analytics to support outcomes of knee total joint arthroplasty in Alberta

## BACKGROUND
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease involving the breakdown of articular cartilage in joints. OA is the most common form of arthritis and is one of the main causes of functional disability, as it affects approximately 10% of Albertans [1]. Pain, decreased function, and disability are commonly associated with hip and knee OA [2-5]. Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is an evidence based intervention for moderate to severe knee OA, with demonstrated effectiveness in reducing pain, improving function and quality of life [6-12]. Level of function, or usual daily activity, post-operatively is becoming particularly important as an outcome for patients undergoing TJA [13, 14]. This study focused on total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and the use of wearable technology to optimize patient outcomes from surgery 

This subject matter has been an area of focus of the Bone and Joint Health Strategic Clinical Network (BJH SCN) Hip and Knee Working Group and the Alberta Bone and Joint Health Institute (ABJHI). 

### THE PROBLEM
Research findings indicate that physical activity, that leads to building muscle strength and endurance, is a key factor supporting successful recovery post-TKA [18, 19]. The current challenge related to physical activity faced by surgeons and allied health professionals is the ability to measure function of TKA patients in an easy and relatively accurate manner that is meaningful for the patient and the clinician. Currently, any information about level of physical activity is based on self-reports that are likely highly inaccurate. The additional challenge of motivating patients to be become or remain active when pain and other factors, such as obesity, presents a real barrier to engaging in physical activities.

## THE SOLUTION	
The application of an innovative wearable-based behavior modification platform (Vivametrica technology: www.vivatmetrica.com) in this clinical space may provide a solution to our stated problem. The Vivametrica technology (via the “VivaMe Health Risk Assessment”) is a wellness and disease risk prediction tool that provides objective assessment of physical function, overall health, and disease risk based on 11 questions and activity data (e.g. number steps walked) from a wearable device. The technology provides analysis of physical function, as well as an overall health score out of 100 that is benchmarked against the general population, matched for age and gender. Also, personalized ‘wellness scores’ for each of the variables are provided including risk scores for heart diseases, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, lung disease, low back pain, depression, and happiness.

### Research Questions
To test the real-world application of this innovative Vivametrica technology, our research questions are:
1. a) Does continuous access to a web-based portal with activity monitoring, goal setting, and disease risk prediction profiling for heart diseases, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, lung disease, low back pain, depression, and happiness (Vivametrica technology) a) mediate levels of patient reported outcomes (pain, joint stiffness, disability, and quality of life) within 6 weeks and 3-months post-TKA and b) mediate patient satisfaction at 6 weeks post-TKA?
2. a) Is objectively measured physical activity behavior associated with a) improved patient reported outcomes (pain, joint stiffness, disability, and quality of life) at 6 weeks and 3 months post-TKA and b) patient satisfaction at 6 weeks post TKA?
3. a) Is a decrease in predicted risk for heart diseases, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, lung disease, low back pain, depression, and increased happiness associated with a) improved patient reported outcomes (pain, joint stiffness, disability, and quality of life) at 6 weeks and 3 months post-TKA and b) associated with patient satisfaction 6 weeks post-TKA?
4. What are the experiences and perceptions of TKA patients of the Vivametrica web-based portal technology? 
5. What is the feasibility of the uptake of the Vivametrica web-based portal in hip and knee clinics in Alberta?

Not all of these research questions are addressed by the code presented in this working file. 

Summary of the Project: This study will prospectively follow 60 patients scheduled for a TKA, recruited across four clinics in Alberta. These 60 patients will be assigned to the intervention group from the cohort of patients who agree to participate in the study and will receive the wearable and Vivametrica technology web-portal access. We will identify 60 age, sex, body mass index (BMI), surgeon/site, and co-morbidity matched controls retrospectively, who underwent a TKA at the site in the previous 5 years. Following post-operative data collection at 3-months, intervention group participants and clinicians (surgeons, physiotherapists, nurses) will be invited to participate in semi-structured interviews (see Appendix) to explore their experience with the innovation, perceptions of impact on patients, and outcomes and feasibility of the Vivametrica technology.



## Caveats for this repository
This project is currently ongoing and the data is considered confidential under the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board (CHREB) at the University of Calgary, therefore, the data cannot be posted to the internet. The .RMD file has been posted for transparency, but is still a work in progress.
